_UI_

Visual Identity Crisis

Right now, the UI looks like:

“A Tailwind template that has dreams, but has not yet achieved self-actualization.”

Your app is premium-oriented but the design language still screams MVP:

Emojis as primary icons → instant “non-professional” vibe.

Construction color palette → borderline cliché.

Generic system fonts → kills the premium tone you want.

Fix:

Move to:

Custom neutral palette (sand/charcoal/steel)

Icons from Lucide, not emojis

Poppins or Inter for UI + Orbitron/Marcellus for branding

This will feel less “DIY calculator” and more “engineering-grade product.”
