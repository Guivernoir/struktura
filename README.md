# Struktura - The Unified Engineering & Construction Intelligence Platform

## 🚀 The Vision

**Struktura** is an all-in-one calculation engine designed to bridge the gap between high-level engineering precision and practical field application. From a homeowner estimating a kitchen remodel to a structural engineer verifying load-bearing requirements, this platform provides a single source of truth for the building industry.

### Why This Matters

The construction industry is fragmented. Engineers use specialized software, contractors use spreadsheets, and homeowners use guesswork. [Project Name] unifies these workflows into one interoperable ecosystem.

## 🏗 Technical Architecture (MVP)

The project is built for modularity, allowing new engineering disciplines to be added as independent "packages."

- **Core Engine:** Handles unit conversions, localized cost data, and material databases.
- **Module System:** Extendable API for specific calculations (e.g., F = m . a for mechanical or load distribution for structural).
- **Export Layer:** Generates professional-grade spreadsheets for bids and engineering reports.

## 🚩 The Scaling Challenge: Why We Are Seeking Partners

This project has reached a critical mass. The scope encompasses multiple professional disciplines, each requiring rigorous validation and UI/UX attention. To maintain the current momentum and ensure the highest safety standards, **we are transitioning from a solo-developer project to a community and corporate-backed initiative.**

**Current Bottlenecks:**

- **Validation:** Professional-grade peer review of engineering formulas.
- **Localization:** Integrating region-specific building codes (IBC, Eurocodes, etc.).
- **Integration:** Building connectors for BIM software and ERP systems.
